### Requirements List based on User Feedback:

#### Tracking Fast Moving Objects on Videos:
1. **Detection Task:**
   - Implement the `detect_fast_moving_objects` function to identify fast-moving objects in videos without using CV trackers or deep learning solutions.
   - Ensure accurate detection of fast-moving objects with high speed and late appearance in videos.

2. **Tracking Task:**
   - Develop the `track_fast_moving_objects` function to track the detected fast-moving objects without using ROI selection.
   - Enable continuous tracking of fast-moving objects even at high speeds.

3. **Modular Approach:**
   - Implement the `DetectionModule` and `TrackingModule` classes with `detect` and `track` methods respectively for modular organization and reusability.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Enhance the `handle_errors` function to provide detailed error messages and handle exceptions gracefully during detection and tracking tasks.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement the `optimize_performance` function to enhance the efficiency of detection and tracking algorithms, considering algorithmic improvements and parallel processing.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Generate comprehensive documentation using the `generate_documentation` function to explain the detection and tracking algorithms, parameters, and expected outputs.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough testing and validation of the detection and tracking tasks using the `test_and_validate` function to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Note to Developer:
You are tasked with implementing the provided functions and classes to address the user's feedback on fast-moving object detection and tracking. Ensure that each requirement is met, and the code functions as expected without violating the restrictions specified. Your implementation should focus on accuracy, efficiency, and robust error handling. If you encounter any issues or require further guidance, feel free to seek assistance.
